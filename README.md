## ✨ What Is This?

This is a *totally scientific* and *100% accurate* mind reader built with C++. Not really, im just kidding. It's actually suck, but at least i think it's cute ( ꈍ◡ꈍ).

## 💻 How It Works

You think of a number (1–10).  
The program "reads your mind". ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## 🎮 How to Run

```bash
g++ -o mind_reader mind_reader.cpp
./a.out
```
or if you using clang (like me ദ്ദി ᗜˬᗜ✧):

```clang++ -std=c++20 -o mind-reader mind-reader.cpp
./mind-reader```
